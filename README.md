# Ames Housing Price Prediction – Linear Regression

This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa, using cleaned and preprocessed housing data. It demonstrates an end-to-end regression 
workflow from EDA to model evaluation.


## Project Goals

- Understand relationships between housing features and sale price  
- Apply data preprocessing techniques  
- Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model  
- Identify and reduce multicollinearity  
- Interpret model results and error metrics

##  Workflow Summary
1. Load and inspect Ames housing dataset
2. Clean and preprocess numerical & categorical features
3. Use dummy encoding for categorical variables
4. Check multicollinearity using VIF
5. Fit a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate using R² and RMSE
7. Interpret key predictors of house price
